## PyTorch

This project involved setting up a Python virtual environment and using the PyTorch framework to build, train, and evaluate a basic neural network model. The focus was on key deep learning concepts such as data loading, model architecture design, training using stochastic gradient descent, and evaluating model performance on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Skills developed included working with PyTorch's DataLoader, defining neural network layers, implementing training loops, and making predictions.
