## Hierarchical Clustering

This project involved performing hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) on socioeconomic data from various countries. Each country was represented as a 6-dimensional feature vector based on statistics like Population, Net Migration, GDP, Literacy, Phones, and Infant Mortality. The tasks included loading and processing the data, calculating feature vectors, implementing HAC without using scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage(), and visualizing the clustering process. Key skills covered included data normalization, computing Euclidean distances, and creating dendrogram visualizations using matplotlib. The project emphasized the importance of data preprocessing, clustering algorithms, and visual interpretation of socioeconomic similarities between countries.
