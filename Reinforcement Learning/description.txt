This project involves implementing a Q-Learning algorithm to navigate the FrozenLake-v1 environment from Farama Gymnasium. The focus is on understanding and applying core concepts of reinforcement learning, such as the Q-value update rule, Îµ-greedy policy, and the use of hyperparameters like learning rate and discount factor. Skills developed include working with gym environments, managing virtual environments, and testing RL policies.
