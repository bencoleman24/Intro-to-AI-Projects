## LeNet

This project focused on implementing and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch, specifically the LeNet-5 architecture. Key tasks included setting up the MiniPlaces dataset, building the LeNet-5 model, counting the number of trainable parameters, and experimenting with different training configurations. Skills developed included designing CNN architectures, understanding and calculating model parameters, and fine-tuning training hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs to optimize model performance on scene recognition tasks.
