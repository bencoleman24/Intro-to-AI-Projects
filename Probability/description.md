## Probability

This project involved implementing a probabilistic model to identify whether a shredded letter was written in English or Spanish. The project required developing a Python program to count character frequencies from a text file, applying Bayes' rule to compute the conditional probabilities, and making a language prediction based on these calculations. Key skills covered included text processing, probabilistic modeling using Bayes' theorem, and working with multinomial distributions. The project also emphasized computational considerations such as avoiding underflow and handling log-domain calculations for robust probability computations.
